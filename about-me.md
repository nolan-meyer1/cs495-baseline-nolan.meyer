# What programming languages have you used?

### The languages that I have used consist of Python, Java, C, C++. I also have very little bit of experience Kotlin,HTML,CSS but I wouldn't consider myself very proficient

# Did you code mostly in classes, internships, real jobs, or personal projects? Put example projects and what did you do.

### I have done most of my coding in class related work. I have also done a few personal projects. One of my favorite projects I did was probably last semester when we made an application that supported hundreds of theme parks and let you see the wait time information as well as showing where they were on the map, and a bunch of other various features that you expect out of an app based around a theme park. I'm also working on a tool that will help integrate canvas with GitHub classroom for another proffesor that heavily utilizes things like GitHub actions to make it work. 

# What was the largest program/system youâ€™ve worked on?

### I think that the project I did about theme parks was probably the largest program that I have worked on. 

# What do you feel most comfortable doing in code?

### I think that I feel most comfrotable writing code that handles like more of the back end work and computation of things. 

# What do you feel least comfortable doing?

### I feel least comfortable with front end things mostly because I just don't really have much experience around that kind of stuff but it's something I'm really interested in getting myself versed in!
