I didn't use very much AI for this assignment. I used it one time to make sure that my structure for the .yml file was correct. I have used GitHub actions before in another personal project, but it has been a few months since I had messed with it so I forgot how the structure was. I also used AI to see if there was another way to check if something was alphanumeric in python that is where I found out there is a .isalnum() method. Other then that everything else was done by myself!
